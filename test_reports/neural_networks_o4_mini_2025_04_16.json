    "Deep learning has matured from simple artificial neural networks into a structured taxonomy of architectures—including discriminative (CNNs, RNNs), generative (autoencoders, GANs) and hybrid models—each tailored to supervised, unsupervised or mixed‐objective tasks.",
    "While deep learning powers diverse real‐world applications (healthcare diagnostics, visual recognition, text analytics, cybersecurity, IoT), model design remains challenging due to data variability and a lack of interpretability, motivating research on robust training algorithms and explainable architectures."
